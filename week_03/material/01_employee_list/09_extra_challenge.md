**Are you ahead of schedule?** Luckily for you there is always something to do!

Here’s a couple bonus challenges for you, if you feel confident:

1.  Right now, the main API response comprises employee 1-6. Rewrite the call so you will instead receive employee 7-12.
2.  The reqres API is responding with 6 employees by default. Rewrite the call to receive a different amount - let’s say 4 or all 12?

I can hint that it has something to do with `query params`...

**Remember the TDD flow, write your test first and let it guide you.**

Now, off you go to to play!
