## The problem statement
An agency has been seeing good growth and would like to expand their business and bump up their employee numbers. They have asked us to help them create a simple employee management system. They would like to have all employees displayed in a list with the possibility to view additional information about each individual. 

We have drawn up the following lo-fi to guide us:

As mentioned, the agency would like to be able to view additional information about their employees. We will solve this by adding a **trigger** effect to the View button which will display a modal (a pop-up) with the specified employee's details when clicked. 
Further down the line, the agency would also like to be able to *update* the details or *delete* the employee completely, but for now, let's focus on *getting* the information.

## Learning objectives
During this exercise you will get acquainted with the HTTP verbs. You will create and modify your own request-response scenarios, where you will send requests to an external API and in turn use the API's response to display dynamic data in your app.  
As always, we will solve our tasks in a test-driven manner with a good Git flow. :metal:
  
- Visualizing dynamic data
- Basic knowledge of RESTful APIs
- Sending API requests with Axios
- Practising the HTTP verbs and working with params
