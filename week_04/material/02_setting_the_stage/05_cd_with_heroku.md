## Setting up Continous Deployment with Heroku

- You need to have created a Heroku application, we will go over this in a demo this week. If we have not delivered that demo yet, skip this part for now.

- Go to your Heroku dashboard and click on ur project.

- Go to the deploy settings tab and activate Github as the applications deployment method

- Underneath that option you should now be able to connect the Heroku application to a specific repo(your rails_demo application).

- Now you need to decide which branch you want to be deployed, pick the master branch

- Now click the button that says "Enable Automatic Deploys"
