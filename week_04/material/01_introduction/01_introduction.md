In this course, we introduce Ruby on Rails, a popular and in-demand framework that allows programmers to build complex, exciting web applications. We will use Ruby on Rails to build our own API's. We do that through complex testing strategies that will show you understand how testing can greatly improve your workflow. During the course, we deepen our knowledge of external libraries (gems), APIs and WebSockets.
