2.  **tree** — A tree object contains references to other blobs or subtrees.
3.  **commit** — A commit object contains the reference to another tree object and some other information (author, committer etc.)
4.  **tag** — A tag or a tag object is a reference to a commit object and can be used for easier referencing.
