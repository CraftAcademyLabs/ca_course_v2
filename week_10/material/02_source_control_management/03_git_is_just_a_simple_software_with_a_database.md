## Git in a nutshell
If you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. Somebody made a comparison between using Git and clocks vs cars. Bear with me. 

Clock users have no need to know how a clock works behind the dial. We just want to know what time it is. Those who understand the inner workings of a clock canâ€™t really tell time any more skillfully than the rest of us.

Using Git is more like driving a car. Lots of people, including me, use cars without knowing much about how they work. However, people who really understand cars, and their inner workings, tend to get better performance out of them. 

The question for you is, what sort of driver do you want to be - where does your ambition level lie?
