## Some basic-basic truths. 
We all know the following:

A good knowledge of any Version Control System is mandatory for all programmers or software developers because we all need to do check-in or check-out code every day. Unless we work on a... No, actually, I can't come up with any reason NOT to use a VCS in any situation. Especially if you develop any kind of software in a collaborative setting.

What are the alternatives?

Without a VCS in place, you would probably be working together in a shared folder on the same set of files. Somehow communication with your fellow team members (probably shouting through the office) that you are currently working on file "xyz" and that, meanwhile, everybody else should keep their fingers off. It is not an acceptable workflow, and even if you might think that this is absurde - it is actually quite common among developers (well, at least versions of the above).  It's extremely error-prone as you're essentially doing open-heart surgery all the time: sooner or later, someone will overwrite someone else's changes.

With a VCS, on the other hand, everybody on the team is able to work (almost) absolutely freely - on any file at any time. The VCS will later allow you to merge all the changes into a common version. There's no question where the latest version of a file or the whole project is. It's in a common, central place: your Version Control System.
