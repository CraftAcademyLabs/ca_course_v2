At its core, debugging is the process of locating and correcting code errors in a computer program - aka bugs. However, debugging techniques also play a vital role in the process of writing software. In this section, we will take a closer look at various ways to work effectively with debugging. Also, Git is a powerful tool not only for version control and team collaboration but also for debugging code. We'll take a look at, and practice, some of that.

Obviously, we all want to avoid bugs and erroneous code. You should write code and design architecture in a way that makes debugging unnecessary. The implemented code should be written in a way that makes it obvious how it works. However, ultimately it seems impossible to eliminate bugs and debugging altogether. I believe we can all agree on that. So, the conclusion should be that since it's hard to avoid some errors to be introduced to our software, learning how to find bugs fast is a valuable skill.

We will look at:

-   basic debugging concepts
-   debugging tools for web based applications as well as PHP and Java
-   debugging in VSCode
-   debugging in InltelliJ
