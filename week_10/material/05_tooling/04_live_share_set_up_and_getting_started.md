### Downloading the Extension

The very first step to taking advantage of Live Share is to install it just like any other extension. In VS Code, you can open up the extensions tab, search for Live Share, click install, and then reload when the install is finished.

After that, you'll need to sign in to the service. As of now, you can choose to login with a Microsoft account or your Github account. To sign in, use the "Sign In" button in the bottom status bar with the person icon. Your browser will open and you will be rerouted to the sign-in page for the service. The same thing will happen if you attempt to start a new live session without being logged in (see below).

### Sharing and Joining a Session

After you're all signed in, you're ready to create a session to share with others. As you'll see you will be granting users certain access that can be detrimental if used incorrectly. **Only share live sessions with people you trust, but that goes without saying, right?**

Start a new session by clicking your username in the bottom status bar and choose "Start Collaboration Session" from the available options. Alternatively, you can open the Command Palette ( CMD+SHIFT+P on OsX, CTRL+SHIFT+P on Windows & Linux) and type "Start Collaboration Session"

To invite someone to your session, you need to share a link to the session with them. Repet the procedure of clicking on your user name and select "Invite Others (Copy Link)" from the pop-up. You will get a notification that your link has been copied. You can text, email, or Slack the link to whoever you want to invite... whatever works for you. Just don't make it public, please.

### Joining a session

From the invitee point of you, to accept an invite, click on the link you received and follow the instructions.

You can also jon a session directly from VSCode. Click your username in the bottom status bar and choose "Join Collaborative Session". Alternatively, as above, you can open the Command Palette ( CMD + SHIFT + P on Mac, CTRL + SHIFT + P on Windows) and type "Join Collaborative Session".When prompted, enter the collaborative session link sent to you by the inviter.

After a short while, you will be let into the session and can start collaborating.

### Work the code!

By default, on joining a session the invitee will automatically follow the inviter as he/she navigates code. This will happen until the invitee makes a move themselves. From there, both sides are free to navigate and edit as they see fit. Additionally, both sides will see a marker showing where the other editor is.

There are many neat functions in Live Share that will make your collaboration flow effective. Both sides can track the actions of the other side and follow along the coding process. In the image below, you can see code highlighting coming across collaborating parties.

**There's plenty of functionality in Live Share that needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Let's make a mob-exercise on this topic and get our hands dirty. Let's get to work.**
