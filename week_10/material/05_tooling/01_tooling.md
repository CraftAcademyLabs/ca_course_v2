The choice of what programming languages we use is either a personal choice or a necessity imposed on us by the job we have. Some languages are designed to enhance productivity, other seem to hinder it. ;-) That is of course a very opinionated statement, so let's leave it at that. We are here to look into ways to become more productive no matter what language and framework we are currently working with.

**My main point is that tools, not just the language itself, makes a developer productive.** Tools can make up for flaws in languages (but also enhance productivity for languages that are just fine), and make up for any knowledge flaws/gaps of ours. If used right, of course.

We will take a look at some ways to use various tools and extensions in VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA that can help us to become more productive.

A word of caution before we move on, sometimes it takes some time to get the right tools, learn how to use them, and practice, before we can reap the rewards. Countless hours can be saved over the long-term by spending just a few productive minutes now.

**Sometimes, you have to spend a little time today to save a lot of time later. Well, I would also argue that** **you have to spend a lot of time now to save {little_time * N == lot_of_time} later.**
