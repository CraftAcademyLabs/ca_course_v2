### Getting up to speed with Live Share

Let's take Live Share for a spin and try some things out. Designate one person of your team to set up a session and share the link with the rest of the team. Then we will perform some common actions like creating files, adding some code and committing to version control.

Remember to communicate. Pair- or mob-programming is all about communication. If you are co-located - then talk to each other directly, if you are a distributed team, use Teams or Slack to keep everybody in the loop (we will take a closer look at Live Share Audio in another exercise).

1.  Create a project folder called "live_session_demo", cd into that folder and open up VSCode
2.  Create a collaboration session
3.  Copy the link and share with the rest of the team
4.  Create an index.html file in the root folder. and add a boilerplate document structure. Add whatever content you like to the <body> tag you like.
5.  As collaborators/invitee try to add some HTML markup or JavaScript code to the document.
6.  Stage your additions to git and make a commit directly from the VSCode

At this stage we want to examine the commit and see if we get all participants as co-authors of the commit. Is that a good thing? I personally think so?

Spend a few minutes reflecting on what this functionality means for you as a developer and how you can use it in your personal, as well as in your teams workflow.

> **Don't close the session when your done, we will get back to it in the next exercise.**
