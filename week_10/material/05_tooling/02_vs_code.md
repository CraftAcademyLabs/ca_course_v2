Visual Studio Code (VSCode ) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, OsX and Linux. It is considered half-way between an text editor and an IDE.

Some advantages of VSCode as of 2019.

-   It has a great ecosystem of plugins for supporting various languages and tools/systems like VCS, code completion, and formatting, etc
-   It is fully customizable and allows you can install keymaps from text editors like sublime text, atom, vim, so you can feel at home if you choose make a switch.
-   It is cross-platform: meaning that whenever you are on Windows, Mac or Linux.
-   It comes with a built-in support for Javascript, TypeScript, NodeJs with a options to support other languages (Java, C, C++, C#, Python, etc).

**Also, with the relatively new Visual Studio Live Share extension, it allows for developers to collaborate in real-time. More on that later.**
