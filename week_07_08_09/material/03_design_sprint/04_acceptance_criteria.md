### Acceptance Criteria

Once we have defined a set of features and chores for each epic, it is time to start thinking about the **definition of done**. We create a list of **Acceptance Criteria** for each entry in our backlog. This list is crucial for setting a scope for the feature and defining when the feature should be considered done and delivered. (In real projects these criteria are agreed upon with the client. In our simulation, we will be responsible for setting them within the team.)

Good Acceptance Criteria will help you get from “It Works as Coded” to “It Works as Intended.”

Microsoft Press defines Acceptance Criteria as “Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer or other stakeholder.” Google defines them as “Pre-established standards or requirements a product or project must meet.”. These definitions are on a large scale.

We want to find a definition that fits our needs of setting criteria on an granular level of Features and User Stories.

Acceptance Criteria must be expressed clearly, in simple language the customer would use, just like the User Story, without ambiguity as to what the expected outcome is: what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. They must be testable: easily translated into one or more manual/automated test cases.

Acceptance Criteria may reference what is in the project’s other user stories or lo-fi's to provide details, but should not be a re-hash of them. They should be relatively high-level while still providing enough detail to be useful. They should include:

-   **Functional Criteria**: Identify specific user tasks, functions or business processes that must be in place. A functional criterion might be “A user is able to access a list of available reports.” A non-functional criterion might be “Edit buttons and Workflow buttons comply with the Site Button Design.”
-   **Non-functional Criteria**: Identify specific non-functional conditions the implementation must meet, such as design elements. A non-functional criterion might be “Edit buttons and Workflow buttons comply with the Site Button Design.”
-   **Performance Criteria**: If specific performance is critical to the acceptance of a user story, it should be included. This is often measured as a response time, and should be spelled out as a threshold.
