### Features and Chores

Each epic will in turn consist of **several features** each one of them described in the form of a user story.

A **feature** is a distinguishing characteristic or capability of a software application or library (e.g., performance, portability, or functionality). A feature delivers some **business value** and is therefore easy to describe in the form of a **User Story**.

Apart from features, that by definition need to deliver some business value and a visible result, we will also define and describe several chores. Chores are development work not resulting intangible product changes but still needs to be performed by the team.

-   stories that are necessary, but provide no direct, obvious value to the customer. They represent need generated by feature stories rather than feature stories themselves.
-   typically essential jobs establishing internal framework or critical support to one or more stories. Examples would be 'Set up development environment', 'Add Travis CI', or 'Find out why detailed test suite takes so long'.
-   an ongoing cost of doing business. They are a drain on resources without contributing to velocity but are nonetheless needed.
-   not necessarily menial or basic jobs- they are often very complex and require the same skill and experience that feature stories would. There is no less need or simplicity in a chore; it is simply categorized differently to refine the calculation of velocity.
