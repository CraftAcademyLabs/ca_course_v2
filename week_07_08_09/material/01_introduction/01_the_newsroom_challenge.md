This Week Lab, we'll be returning to the exciting and complex world of News Publications and build a fully-featured news platform.

This challenge will differ a bit from the previous ones in the curriculum. We will simulate a real project and go through the entire process of a Design Sprint first before we start writing our implementation.

Learning Objectives

- Learn about Agile methodologies (Scrum + XP - Software Craftsmanship)
- Practice project collaboration - planning, organizing ideas and tasks, capturing requirements
- Advanced project collaboration like onboarding new team members and joining a new team
- Practice more advanced strategies for  CI, CD, and DevOps
- Practice more advanced rails concepts like Action Mailer, Active Storage, ActiveJob.

In this challenge, we'll be going over a lot of concepts in the form of demos and mod programming sessions. This is what the course is all about - learning while solving real-life problems. The pressure will be high, as we introduce a lot of new technologies and strategies to build engaging features, but also in terms of the project, management, and team collaboration. 

When you’re building your system, you’d probably be thinking a lot about features and making sure it’s not full of bugs. Do NOT forget about the UX, a vastly important part of every web-based application these days — and one that is sometimes overlooked.  It often makes the difference between a failure and a success of your app.

Here are some pointers identified as must-haves by many UX developers:

- Frictionless signups
- Focus on your target audience
- Simple onboarding
- Very easy-to-use UI
- Personable
- Appealing design
