Create a new React application using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) and give it a meaningfull name like
`redux-demo`. Make sure you clean up the application from any code you will not use (see previous sections). 

Remember that for the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

* `public/index.html` - the page template;
* `src/index.js` -  the JavaScript entry point.
  
You can delete or rename the other files.
