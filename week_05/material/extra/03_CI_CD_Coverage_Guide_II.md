This guide is similar to the last, but targets a frontend React application. Make sure you've done the previous CI CD Coverage coursework for a Ruby on Rails api backend before moving on.

The **Code Climate** implementation is identical to the last guide, so go ahead and add your React repo and save the `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID`
