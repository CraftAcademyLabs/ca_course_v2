Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).

In today's digital world, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) generally refers to a new and alternative way of accessing software, as opposed to more traditional methods of access.

Whereas in the past software would generally be purchased outright and loaded onto a device, SaaS normally refers to a subscription based model where the software is hosted in the cloud and accessed via the internet. There are a number of benefits of this to consumers, whether that is individuals using software for private purposes, or businesses.

There are many well-known examples of SaaS, including Office 365, G-suite ,Salesforce, Citrix GoToMeeting, Cisco WebEx and Netflix.

Examples of where SaaS can be used by enterprises:

 - Accounting and invoicing 
 - Tracking sales 
 - E-commerce marketplaces
 - Planning 
 - Performance monitoring
- Communications (including webmail and messaging)

SaaS is a natural evolution of software. The old model of getting physical DVDs and installing on local servers was the only realistic solution for many years. In fact, the client-server model is still required for many scenarios. That said, in recent years a number of developments have allowed SaaS to become mainstream. One factor is bandwidth; the internet is simply faster than it was a decade ago. Other major factors include the evolution of both virtualization and tools in big data. All these advances have made it much easier for providers to scale and manage their own infrastructure and thus provide SaaS solutions.

**TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE**
Users purchase the software upfront as a package and then install it onto their computer
Licenses may be limited to the number of users and/or devices where the software can be deployed
Updates are distributed manually by authorized staff
**SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE**
Users subscribe to the software, usually on a monthly basis, rather than purchase it, meaning no upfront costs
Users can usually end their subscription when they no longer require it
Applications are updated and used online with files saved in the cloud rather than on individual computers
The required software can be subscribed to via the internet and then accessed online via any computer in the office using a username and password
If needs change they can easily switch to software that better meets their requirements
Everyone who needs access to a particular piece of software can be set up as a user
### BENEFITS OF SAAS
**NO HARDWARE COSTS** - Processing power is supplied by the cloud provider

**NO INITIAL SETUP COSTS** Applications are ready to use once the user subscribes

**PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE** - Particularly beneficial when something is only required for a short period

**USAGE IS SCALABLE** - Additional storage or services can be accessed on demand without needing to install new software and hardware

**UPDATES ARE AUTOMATIC** - Updates are often free of change and deployed automatically by the software provider

**CROSS DEVICE COMPATIBILITY** - Applications can be accessed via any internet enabled devices, such as desktops, smartphones and tablets

**ACCESSIBLE FROM ANY LOCATION** - Users arenâ€™t restricted to one location and can access applications from any internet enabled device

**APPLICATIONS CAN BE CUSTOMISED AND WHITE LABELLED** - Applications can often be altered to suit the needs and branding of particular customers

**CONCERNS**
Nothing is perfect, of course, and SaaS is no exception. Companies that adopt multiple Software as a Service application or plan to connect hosted software with existing on-premise apps may encounter software integration headaches along the way. Security is another common concern for businesses mulling SaaS options: Whenever sensitive company data and business processes are entrusted to a third-party service provider, issues such as identity and access management must be addressed. Businesses must also take into account the government compliance regulations inherent in storing customer data in a remote data center.
