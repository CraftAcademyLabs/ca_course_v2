## Focus on the user experience

UX design is the process used to determine what the experience will be like when a user interacts with your application. 

If UX is the experience that a user has while interacting with your product, then UX Design is, by definition, the process by which we determine what that experience will be. BDD asks questions about the UX of your system before and during development to reduce miscommunication. 

- Requirements are written down as user stories

- Low Fidelity sketches provide a lightweight flow of how a user interacts with the system.

- BDD concentrates on UX vs. implementation (TDD)

## The “Connextra” format

User stories are used with agile methodologies as the basis for defining the functions a  system must provide and to manage requirements. They capture the "who", "what" and "why" of a requirement in a simple, concise way, often limited in detail by what can be hand-written on a small card.
```
  As a <role>
  So that/In order to <business value>
  I want to <feature>
```
The above user story format is the one we will be using to describe the application. It is centered around three important questions:

- Who's using the system?

- What are they doing?

- Why do they care?

A user story can be formulated as a acceptance test before any code is written. The same feature can be described by viewing it from a different stakeholder perspective.

See dishes that are available
```
As a customer
So that I can select a dish 
I want to see a list of available dishes
```
Display dishes that are available
```
As a restaurant owner
So that I can receive orders from the site's visitors
I want to be able to display a list of available dishes
```
Think about these two User stories, they seem to be almost identical. But are they in fact identical? 

## Lo-Fi's

Low-fidelity prototypes (LoFi's) of the systems views are rough representations of concepts that help us validate those concepts early on in the design process. Working with transforming user stories to low-fidelity prototypes is a unique way to radically improve your work and to build a UX in which user's needs can be truly realized.

- Design thinking advocates for "thinking with your hands" as a way to build empathetic solutions.

- Lean startup relies on early validation and the development of a minimum viable product to iterate on.

- User-centered design calls for a collaborative design process where users deliver continual feedback based on their reactions to a product's prototype.
