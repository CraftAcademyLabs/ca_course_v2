## Agile principles

Remember, it's not just about the code. This challenge is about practicing the workflow, solving problems, learning how to collaborate as a team and much more.

There are different Agile practices you can use in this and other projects, and we will be talking a lot about that and introducing different agile techniques as we move along in the course. For now, you should always follow these core Agile principles:

- Focus on user needs

- Deliver iteratively

- Keep improving how your team works

- Fail fast and learn quickly

- Keep planning and stick to your plan

**Remember, XP supplements the Scrum process with practices like:**

- Automated unit testing

- Refactoring

- Continuous integration

- Behavior Driven Design

- Test Driven Development

## Planning and Communication

Your team needs to plan together, review these plans regularly and change them based on your progress and any new facts and requirements that arise during the development process. 

The section below is about 2 tools that you can use as an alternative to [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). 

Both [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/) and [ZenHub.io](https://zenhub.io/) are project management tools powered by your GitHub Issues & Pull Requests. Waffle.io is the tool of choice for many projects and provides a web-based interface for managing Issues and track Pull Requests. ZenHub provides similar functionality (and more) as a browser extension. 

For this project, we have decided that you will use the Pivotal tracker. We have provided you with all the features and chores that are a part of the MVP.

## Setting up the project

### Rails API

In order to get you started with Rails, we've set up a boilerplate application using the following setup:

- Rails 6.0.2

- RSpec - a testing framework that we will be using for unit testing and request specs

- ShouldaMatchers - to simplify our testing in RSpec

- Coveralls - to get coverage on our testing

Your very first assignment is the get that code working and run the application on your development machines. Make use of all the previous challenges to find answers to obstacles you might encounter.

We have created one upstream repository for each team that is based on this boilerplate.

[Upstream repository](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slowfood_api_jan_21)

So make sure that everyone in the team forks this repository.

### React Client

In order to get started with the React client, we have also set up a boilerplate application for that:

- React - scaffolded with `create-react-app`

- Cypress for acceptance testing

As with the Rails API, make sure that everyone forks their team's upstream repository.
