## SlowFood Challenge

This week's challenge is to build an Online Food Ordering System - a web-based application that allows customers to order their food for home delivery, or for pick up from the restaurant. Our imaginary client is a restaurant owner that needs a website where he can list his menu and allow visitors to place orders.

This is the first challenge touching upon the e-commerce domain that we will be working on during the course. **The purpose of this challenge is to simulate a real project and prepare you for the Mid Course Project, that you will be working on in week 6 of the Bootcamp.**

This challenge introduces a new set of technologies and skills you'll need as a developer. The main objective for this challenge is to practice the workflow that we want to use in our projects with a focus on:

-   Agile methods for software development
-   Pair Programming
-   Collaboration using Git and GitHub
-   Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Design

### Learning Objectives

We set the goals high for this week. Apart from programming skills, that are of course in focus at all times, we will be working in teams during this week. Set yourself up to practice and learn more about:

**Use basic Agile practices**

-   self-organizing teams
-   iterative and incremental design*
-   the importance of planning your work

**Learn about Ruby on Rails as an API**

-   understand the concept of ORM's vs SQL (ActiveRecord)
-   understand the MVC structure
-   controllers
-   routes
-   models
-   relation between models
-   concept of `params` (See: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y57OnWV6dRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y57OnWV6dRE))

**Learn more about React**

-   understand how to consume an API
-   understand the different requests (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE)
-   how a react client fits into the MVC structure

**Learn more about User Authentication**

**Learn about the hardships that will occur if we can't read the documentation for libraries we use in our projects (gems & packages).**

**Learn more about Test- and Behavior Driven Development or Acceptance - Unit Test cycle.**

**Embrace and understand the benefits of Pair Programming && collaboration using Git and GitHub**

### Concept of the Week

**Incremental and Iterative Design**: The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system.

-   **Incremental** – adding new functionality in small chunks.
-   **Iterative** – performing repeatedly, i.e. adding new functionality repetitively or cyclically.

### Heads up!

Please note that there may be subtle errors or typos in the following materials. Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging and problem-solving skills
