Okay, moving on… Create a new file named `atm_spec.rb` in your `spec` folder.
```
$ touch spec/atm_spec.rb
```
Let’s add the following test to that file. Note the keywords `describe` and `it`. Also, as in all ruby programs we are creating blocks with the `do` and `end` keywords. **Make it a habit that you always add an** `**end**` **if you type** `**do**`**.**

_spec/atmspec.rb_

Make sure that you run that spec from your terminal.
```
$ rspec spec/atm_spec.rb
```
What will follow now is a series of steps that aims at showing you how testing can drive your development. In the future, you will probably skip some of these steps but for now, bear with me.
