Every feature, no matter how small, will lead to a series of failures. Until it doesn’t. This goes for new, inexperienced programmers, as well as for those of us who have been doing this for a long time. There’s nothing wrong with you. Just get used to it and see everything you do as a learning experience.

Keep your calm, read the error messages that RSpec so kindly throws at you, and make small steps forward. Be thankful that you have a testing framework that helps you to figure out what is wrong with your code. Imagine if you were coding without it?

Alright, enough of coding philosophy. Let’s move on. This is a great time to do a commit and push up your code (Unless you already did that).
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "your commit message"
$ git push your_remote your_branch
```
