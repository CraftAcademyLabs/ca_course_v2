### What is YAML?

YAML is a file format for storing object trees and data serialization which is both human readable and computationally powerful.

All the items in the library must be stored in a `yml` file. The file feeds to be structured this way.

**Note:** _Be mindful when writing in a yaml file. Yaml is sensitive for whitespaces and indentation and if it’s not written correctly, it won’t work!_
