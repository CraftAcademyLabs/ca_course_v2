We are approached by a newly built library. They need an app to keep track of all their books. Luckily they have only received a handful of books so far and this is the perfect time to create a prototype application that will keep track of the books.

**Let’s see what they have to say:**

_“We need an app where both the visitors and the library can see if a list of books is available, it would be nice to see both the title and the author of the book. The library needs to store these books in a file where we can easily check if a book is available or not. The library also needs the visitors to check out books after finding the title they want. Depending on the time of the checkout the library needs the books to be returned within a month and obviously, it would be nice for the visitor to know which date to return the book.”_

**You and your pairing partner need to extract the user stories from the text above. Remember to keep it simple. Being a prototype we just need to see if the app works in IRB.**

Make sure that you remember to add the user stories to your README
