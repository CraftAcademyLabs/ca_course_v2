### I’m hoping to see that:

• You can take a problem set and write a well-tested implementation on your own.

• You understand how to define Ruby Classes and work with objects.

• You understand how classes can interact with each other.

• You know how to make use of arrays, hashes, and associated methods to create dynamic lists.

• You know how to write specs and use them as a blueprint in your development.

• I can track your work by following you commit history - so please commit as soon you are done with a feature or when you have made a test pass.

### In your Pull Request, I’m hoping to see:

• That you are testing the right thing in the right spec file.

• That all tests passing - green is good!

• High test coverage (above 95% is accepted)

• The code is easy to follow: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short, code is nicely formatted, etc.

• The README.md includes information on how to use your solution with command examples in irb.
