The weekend challenge is all about putting what you have learned during the week to practice in a new domain. Everything you need to do to complete this challenge you have already done during the ATM-Challenge

Let’s get it on!

• Challenge time: this weekend, until Monday 9 am

• Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, your notes, previously written code, books, etc.

• If you refer to or have in whole or partially used the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README

• If you have a partial solution, still check in a partial solution to GitHub and create a Pull Request

• You must submit a Pull Request to this repository with your code by 9am Monday morning - before the stand-up

• You need to plan the weekend with your pairing partner so that you can work efficiently.
