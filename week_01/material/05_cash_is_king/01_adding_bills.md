Yeah, remember when we kind of skipped adding bills to our successful output? We can’t ignore that requirement any longer. After all, cash is the reason we use ATM’s.

A part of the output our program is supposed to return on successful withdrawal is an array of bills. We also know that the ATM holds 5, 10 & 20$ bills, right?

Another thing we know is that one of the conditions for a successful transaction is that the amount a user can withdraw is divisible by 5.

Knowing all this, we can build a method that tells us what bills we will get from the ATM.
```
As a Bank Customer    
In order to withdraw funds in even amounts  
I want to receive funds in 5, 10 & 20$ bills
```
