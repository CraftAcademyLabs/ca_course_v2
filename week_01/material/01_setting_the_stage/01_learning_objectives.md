## Learning objectives

1.  Learn how to set up a simple ruby based project
2.  Make use of a testing framework

4.  Practice Pair Programing and sharing code
 

## Action points

In the following sections we will:

-   Set up a simple project

1.  Create a `Gemfile` and add `rspec` as a dependency.
2.  Initiate `rspec`
3.  Modify `.rspec` to output the spec messages in terminal.

-   Create a basic folder structure for your project (production code in `lib`, tests in `spec`)
-   Create a `README.md` with a basic description of the project
-   Initialize and push to a git repository
-   Add your pairing partner as a `git remote`

Let's do it!
