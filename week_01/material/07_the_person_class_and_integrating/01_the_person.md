At this step we want to create a Person class and give him 3 attributes: `:name`, `:cash` and `:account`. We will give you a basic set of specs for that class. Your job will be to implement the code that will make these specs pass.
```
As an ATM operator      
In order to keep track of our costumers     
We want to assign each account to a separate person
```
Remember, you are free to modify these specs if you find any flaws in it OR if you find another way of testing the same behavior.

Making all of these tests pass will bring you closer to completing this challenge.
