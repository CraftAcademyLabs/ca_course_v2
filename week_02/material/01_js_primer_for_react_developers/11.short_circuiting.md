You already know how `&&` works in If-Statements, but perhaps you didn't know they are used to do what is called "short circuiting". Here's how it works:
```
function one() {
  console.log('one was called')
  return false
}
function two() {
  console.log('two was called')
  return false
}

if (one() && two()) {
  console.log('Here we go!')
}

// The only output of this code is "one was called" because of
// short circuiting
```
The only output from this code is "one was called". The output for "Here we go!" is not going to happen because the two function calls return `false`. But why is the function `two()` not called at all? We know it wasn't called because we never get "two was called". The reason is that most programming languages short-circuit, which means when the thing before `&&` is false, then there's no point in checking the rest of the expression because one thing being false means the end result has to be false. Maybe you know most of that but never thought of it that way.

We can take advantage of `&&` and short-circuiting in other place besides if-statements:
```
// This will cause an error if `people` is not an array
function findById(people, id) {
  return people.find(item => item.id === id)
}

// Now we are returning the person if `people` is an array
// If `people` is not an array, we the value whatever is before
// && which is `false` in that case
function findById(people, id) {
  return Array.isArray(people) && people.find(item => item.id === id)
}
```
