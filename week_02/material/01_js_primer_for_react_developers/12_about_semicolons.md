Are semicolons really optional in Javascript?

Perhaps you've heard or seen that semicolons aren't exactly required in JavaScript. There has been a ton of debate on whether or not devs should use them anyways, but the main points usually boil down to:

-   Point: You should use them because there are some edge cases where not having them can be a problem
-   Counterpoint: True, but if we use Babel to "transpile" our code, Babel is going to take the code we wrote without semicolons and it's going to add them back in for us anyways, so why does it matter?
-   Counterpoint: Yes, but... _and it goes on and on_

Whether you like or don't like them is totally up to you. One piece of tooling that seems to normalize the conversation a bit is [prettier.io](https://prettier.io/), a formatting tool which rewrites the code as you type, or as you save, or as you push -- whichever you prefer. With tools like Prettier, many of the "what is your preference" conversations are going away because tooling helps to normalize the code.
