ES2015-ES2018 has brought a lot of new syntax to JavaScript that lets us do things we could always do before, but now with nicer syntax. Here are some notable examples: 

### Shortand for Object Methods
```
You can drop off the `:` and the word `function` for methods when defining them:

const obj = {
  insteadOfThis: function() {
    // do stuff
  },

  youCanDoThis() {
    // do stuff
  }
}
```
Note that the above is not an arrow function, just a shorter syntax for object methods.
