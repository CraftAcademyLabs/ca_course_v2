## Implementing a Netlify Form

We can set up a form using Netlify where we can get the inputs from our site to our Netlify Dashboard and if we want we can be notified by email or Slack.

This is how your `Contact` component should look like, where you want to display your contact form:

To make this work you also need to put this hidden form in the beginning of your `<body>`  in the `index.html` file:

Awesome! As soon as your project has been published with these changes on Netlify you are going to see the form submissions on your Netlify Dashboard.

## Notifications Settings

If you go to `Settings` on your Netlify Dashboard and then go to `Forms` you can change your notifications settings on the bottom on the page. There you can choose to get the submissions from your form either to Slack or your email.
